    <h3>Detailed Analysis & Recommendations</h3>

    <p>
        The elevated WBC count indicates a possible infection or inflammation in the body. Reinforcing your immune system may be beneficial. 
It's advisable to include a diet rich in antioxidants, such as fruits and vegetables. Jamaican herbs like Cerasee and Ginger can also enhance immune function.
    </p>

    <p>
        For the elevated Neutrophils, increasing your intake of Vitamin C-rich foods (citrus fruits, berries) may help reduce inflammation. Lifestyle changes that include regular exercise and adequate sleep are also recommended.
    </p>

    <p>
        The low Lymphocyte count may warrant further investigation. Consider increasing your intake of foods rich in zinc (pumpkin seeds, legumes) and vitamin D (fatty fish). Supplementation of Zingiber (Ginger) could also be explored.
    </p>

    </table>

    <h3>Trends and Observations</h3>
    <p>
        The data shows a trend of elevated white blood cells, primarily neutrophils, which frequently indicates an ongoing infection. Lifestyle changes, including a balanced diet and appropriate exercise, may help manage this concern.
    </p>

    <h3>Probability of Dysfunction</h3>
    <p>
        There is a significant probability of dysfunction in the immune response, indicated by elevated neutrophils and decreased lymphocytes, which necessitate immediate attention toward dietary habits and possibly lifestyle adjustments.
    </p>

    <h3>What to Ask Your Doctor on Your Next Visit</h3>
    <h4>Regarding Elevated WBC and Neutrophil Levels</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>What could be the potential causes of my elevated WBC and neutrophils?</li>
        <li>Do you recommend further tests to identify an underlying issue?</li>
        <li>What lifestyle changes can I make to improve my immune health?</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Regarding Low Lymphocyte Count</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>What dietary changes do you recommend to address my low lymphocyte levels?</li>
        <li>Should I consider supplements to boost my immune response?</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Personalized Health Insights</h3>
    <p>
        As a [Patient's Age] year old [Patient's Gender], consider focusing on a diet rich in fruits, lean proteins, and whole grains. Hydration is essential, along with regular physical activity tailored to your fitness level.
